_______________________________________________________________________________

09-24-2018:
	Red-black tree has been cut off instead of an AA-tree. No apparent bugs. B-plus tree may hide bugs. B-plus tree is too big to invite bugs.
10-14-2018:
	Renaming existed functions in a published library is not a good conduct. I am sorry for the inconvenience that may caused by inconsistent naming. But I rather to eliminate those eyesores in function names.
02-01-2018:
	Some programs in directory ./Examples can't be compiled because of compilers behaved differently that triggered failures during crossing platforms.
05-12-2019:
	Bugs may hide in function grpShortestPathL and grpMinimalSpanningTreeL at file svgraph.h.
02-25-2023:
	2 bugs.
	1) _treFreeTrieNode at file svstree.c. Double free.
	2) strM3Matrix at file svmatrix.c. Wrong answer. Addressing issue.
	Fixed.
07-31-2023:
	1 bug.
	1) grpShortestPathL can not produce correct answer.
11-10-2023:
	1 bug:
	Code:
	#include "svtree.h"
	int main()
	{
		size_t i;
		P_BST p;

		p = treCreateBST();

		i = 1; *p = treBSTInsertAA(*p, &i, sizeof(size_t), _grpCBFCompareInteger);
		i = 2; *p = treBSTInsertAA(*p, &i, sizeof(size_t), _grpCBFCompareInteger);
		i = 3; *p = treBSTInsertAA(*p, &i, sizeof(size_t), _grpCBFCompareInteger);

		i = 2;

		*p = treBSTRemoveAA(*p, &i, sizeof(size_t), _grpCBFCompareInteger);
		/* Wrong answer goes here. */

		treDeleteBST(p);

		return 0;
	}
	Users should use AVL tree instead of AA tree.
	Fixed.
